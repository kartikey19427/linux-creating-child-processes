//Explanation:
The program works according to the fork mechanism.
As soon as the fork function is called, the program splits into 2 programs each with a different pid.
pid=0 goes to the child while pid=1 goes to the parent. A negative pid indicates the fork has failed and that gives an error which is handled by us.
The program with child pid goes to the excelp() statement.
This is where the child program is called and executed, and it replaces the child process by this new program file in the execlp command.
The child process computes the average scores of all section A students and prints their average score after their assignment scores.
The parent process waits for the child process to complete. This is achieved by the waitpid command.
After the child completes, the exit system call is used to terminate the child program with success.
The control is returned to the parent process and the parent process then computes the average score of section B students in the same manner the child process did for section A.


//Errors handled:
Fork failed: if the forks returns a negative pid then the fork has failed.
File cannot be opened: if the file does not exist or it is damaged, this error is shown, and the program exits using the exit(1) system call.
Waitpid was unsuccessful: if waitpid returns a negative pid, either the process does not exist or waitpid was interrupted by a signal.
